AcmeCom’s Apex Web Application has a typical frontend implemented using HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for data input, interaction, and other UI functionality. Both Backbone.js and Spine.js are used as frontend frameworks.
JavaScript and CSS files are stored on Amazon’s CloudFront CDN (Conentent Delivery Network).

Back-end / Server-side:
The Backend is written almost entirely in Ruby with some minor compnants written in Python.

Frameworks:
Rails is used as the Ruby framework, and Django was used for the Python code.

AcmeCom’s development team wrote a simple Database Abstraction layer in Ruby. It is comprised of ten major classes and handles all Database IO from the frontend and the business logic.
